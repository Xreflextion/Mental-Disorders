<h2>What are mood disorders?</h2>

<p> 
  Mood disorders cause changes in one’s emotional state, leading to problems 
  in their daily routine. If someone has a mood disorder, they could either 
  have periods of intense sadness (depression), episodes of excitement and 
  happiness (mania), or both. A few common mood disorders include:
</p>

<p class= "font">Major Depressive Disorder</p>

<img src= "depression.jpg" style= "float: right; border-radius: 10px;">

<p>Major depressive disorder can cause prolonged periods of sadness. 
  Depression affects the way people normally think, feel, and behave. 
  During a depressive episode, one will feel a loss in enthusiasm, 
  mood swings, or just general sadness. Things that used to be interesting 
  won’t be as pleasurable as before. People will find trouble sleeping, 
  and suicidal thoughts will start to enter. The length of an episode is 
  always different, but usually goes on for a few months.
</p>

<p>More signs of major depressive disorder include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Feelings of sadness, emptyness, and hopelessness </li>
  <li>No interest in things that used to be pleasurable</li>
  <li>Irritable, easily annoyed</li>
  <li>Persistent thoughts of suicide, suicide attempts, or suicide</li>
  <li>Trouble with sleeping; either unable to sleep or sleeping too much</li>
  <li>Lack of energy</li>
  <li>Weight problems;loss of appetite or unusually hungry</li>
  <li>Guilt or anxiety over past choices</li>
</ol>

<p class= "font">Persistent Depressive Disorder</p>

<p>Persistent depressive disorder (also known as dysthymia), involves 
  long lasting periods of depression, though less severe. One with persistent 
  depressive disorder will often get periods of mild depression, lasting for years. 
  Although persistent depression disorder might not be as severe as major depression, 
  it can still be serious. The symptoms can range from mild to severe.
</p>

<p class= "font">Bipolar Disorder</p>

<p>Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that causes mood swings, which affect 
  one’s thoughts, energy, sleep, and behavior. The mood swings fall into two 
  categories, highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When someone 
  is in a period of depression, they feel extreme sadness, emptiness, and despair, 
  similar to a major depressive disorder. During a manic episode, one gets an 
  excessive amount of energy and activity. Hypomania is similar to mania, although less severe.
</p>

<p>Symptoms of bipolar disorder include:</p>

<p>Sometimes, a manic episode might trigger psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations.</p>

<p>There are several types of bipolar disorder: </p>

<p><b>Bipolar I</b> includes severe mood swings from both mania and depression.</p>

<p><b>Bipolar II</b> involves hypomanic episodes alternating with periods of severe depression.</p>

<p><b>Mixed Bipolar Episodes</b> refers to a combination of depression and manic symptoms.
  Instead of alternating between depression and mania, 
  a mixed episode involves experiencing both mania and depression symtoms in one episode.
</p>

<p><b>Cyclothimic disorder</b>is a disoder in which one experiences periods of hypomania or mild 
  depression. A less severe form of bipolar.
</p>


<p class= "font">Seasonal Affective Disorder</p>

<p>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD), is a type of depression affected by the change of seasons. 
  Each period of depression starts and ends around the same time every year. Generally, the 
  symptoms start to show during fall and winter, though some might experience moodiness in 
  summer and spring instead. These symptoms usually start out mild, but become more severe as 
  days progress.
