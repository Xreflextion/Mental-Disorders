<h2>How are people with mental disorders treated?</h2>

<p>There are many treatments, depending on the severity of the symptoms. A few common ones include:</p>

<p class= "font2"><b>Medication</b></p>
<img src= "pills.jpg" style= "width: 150px;" >

<h3>Anti-depressants</h3>
<P>Antidepressants are usually used to treat depression, 
	but can also help with anxiety, and other mental disorders with similar symptoms.</P>
<h3>Anti-anxiety medications</h3>
<p>Anti-anxiety medications are typically prescribed for anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder. 
		These medications help for a short period, but a longer use can cause addiction or dependency. </p>
<h3>Mood-stabilizing medications</h3>
<p>Mood-stabilizing medications commonly treat people diagnosed with bipolar disorder and other
	 similar mood disorders. These medications help prevent mood swings between mania and depression.</p>
<h3>Antipsychotic medications</h3>
<p>Antipsychotic medications generally treat psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, but can also be used
	 for people with bipolar disorder who show some psychotic symptoms, usually during a manic episode.</p>

<p class= "font2"><b>Therapy</b></p>

<p>Usually paired with medication, psychotherapy (AKA talk therapy) has proven to be more effective and useful than 
	medicine, by treating a wide range of mental illnesses. Psychotherapy is when a person talks with a therapist 
	about their issues and problems. A therapist helps them cope with their troubles and learn more about their 
	feelings and conditions. These chats can be done either individually, with a group, or with their family.</p>

<p class= "font2"><b>Inpatient and outpatient treatment</b></p>
<img src= "in&out.jpg" style= "float: right;">
<p>There are two types of settings for treating mental disorders, inpatient care and outpatient care.
	 Inpatient treatment is generally for people who display severe symptoms with not much progress made.
	  They are referred to a mental hospital, for treatment 24/7. Another option is outpatient treatment,
	   where someone with mild symptoms can visit a treatment hospital or therapist on certain days each week. 
	These are for people whose symptoms arenâ€™t as severe, so they are able function outside of the mental facility.
