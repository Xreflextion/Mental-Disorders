<h2>What are neurodevelopmental disorders?</h2>

<p>Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of disorders that appear due to 
  damage done during the development of the brain’s nervous system. This
  can affect the learning, communication, memory, emotion, or self-control 
  of a person.
</p>

<p class= "font2">Autism Spectrum Disorders</p>

<img src= "asd.jpg" class= "border" style= "float: right;">

<p>Similar neurodevelopmental disorders were merged into a group called 
  autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autism spectrum disorders included disorders 
  with similar challenges and symptoms. Each disorder faced similar problems 
  with social interactions, communication, or behavior. 
  Three common autism spectrum disorders are:
</p>

<p class= "font">Asperger Syndrome</p>

<p>Asperger syndrome is one of the autism spectrum disorders. It is one of the 
  milder disorders of the group. Someone with Asperger would have difficulty 
  socializing and show an interest in certain topics or display repetitive behavior. 
  They don’t understand and often miss nonverbal social cues, such as a wink or 
  hand notions. Though people with Asperger find it difficult to socialize, they 
  can talk a lot about something they are passionate about, but don’t notice or 
  think about the opposing person’s feelings on the topic.
</p>

<p>Symptoms of Asperger syndrome include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Difficulty understanding nonverbal gestures</li>
  <li>Repetitive speech</li>
  <li>Unusual or robotic tone</li>
  <li>Inability to understand literal phrases or emotional issues</li>
  <li>Generally talks about self rather than others</li>
  <li>Unusual interest in topics</li>
</ol>

<p class= "font">Autistic Disorder</p>

<p>Autistic Disorder</p>

<p>Autistic disorder is the most common condition out of the autism spectrum disorders. 
  Someone with autistic disorder will face social and communication challenges, along 
  with unusual behavior or interests. They might feel uncomfortable with physical contact,
  and feel overly sensitive to the senses they perceive, such as sound or light. 
  Autistic disorder is typically more severe then other autism spectrum disorders. 
</p>

<p>Symptoms include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Repetitive behavior/speech</li>
  <li>Sensitivity to touch, light, or sound </li>
  <li>Delayed speech</li>
  <li>Unresponsive to nonverbal gestures</li>
  <li>Difficulty understanding sarcasm or joking </li>
  <li>Problems with communication</li>
</ol>

<p class= "font">Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified</p>

<p>Pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is an 
  autism spectrum disorder used for people with some autistic symptoms, but not all. 
  The symptoms can be mild, but can also cause difficulty if severe.
</p>

<p class= "font2">Other Disorders:</p>

<p>Apart from the autism spectrum disorders, there are other neurodevelopmental disorders such as:</p>

<p class= "font">Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</p>


<p>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder 
  in which people are full of activity and find it hard to pay attention or control 
  their impulses. While it’s hard for most people to stay focused, it is far more 
  severe for those with ADHD and can cause daily problems. 
  <br>
 There are three types of ADHD: 
</p>
<p><b>Hyperactivity-impulsiveness ADHD</b></p>
<p>Trouble staying still. Someone with this type of ADHD will always appear to be moving.</p>

<p><b>Inattentive ADHD</b></p>
<p>People have difficulty paying attention, and staying focused.</p>

<P><b>Combined ADHD</b></P>
<p>Includes a combination of the two types above.</p>

<p class= "font">Oppositional Defiant Disorder</p>

<p>It’s normal for a child to oppose authority occasionally. 
  However, if someone is consistently arguing and disobeying higher 
  authorities (teachers, parents), then they may have 
  oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). When a person has ODD, 
  they display an irritable mood and constantly talk back or 
  disobey higher figures. This behavior can disrupt their daily routine, 
  along with family or school activities. 
</p>

<p>Symptoms of ODD include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Constantly arguing against higher ups</li>
  <li>Defies or refuses to follow adult's requests or orders</li>
  <li>Deliberately annoys or upsets other people</li>
  <li>Puts the blame on other people, despite being his or her mistake</li>
  <li>Easily annoyed by others</li>
  <li>Vindictive or spiteful</li>
</ol>
