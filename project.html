<h2> What are mental disorders?</h2>

<p>	
	Mental illnesses are health conditions that affect the way a person behaves, thinks, or feels. 
	Even if the symptoms shown are light, any mental disorder can change a person’s everyday life by adding stress. While it isn’t completely clear why mental disorders are developed, 
	studies show that a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors can cause a mental illness to erupt.
