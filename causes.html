<h2>What causes mental disorders?</h2>

<p>Research has shown that different
 factors are needed to trigger a mental illness. Some examples are outlined below.</p>

 <h3>Genetics</h3>

 <p>Someone could inherit a mental illness from their ancestors, through genetics, but it isn’t guaranteed. 
    Even if a person has a relative who has a mental illness, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll
     get one as well, but there is a higher risk compared to others without a heredity mental disorder. 
    There are other factors needed, such as anxiety or a psychological trauma, to trigger a mental illness. </p>

<h3>Brain Damage/Infections</h3>

<p>A mental illness can generate when specific parts of the brain are injured. 
    This is the same for infections, which could trigger or worsen a mental disorder.
     Damage or injuries that are caused while in the womb can often cause a mental illness to occur. </p>

<h3>Environmental</h3>

<p>People who are subjected to a hostile environment in their early years are
     more likely to have a mental disorder. Some environmental issues include divorce,
      neglect, abuse, loss of an important figure, or being in exposed to different
       types of substances.</p>

<h3>Lifestyle</h3>
