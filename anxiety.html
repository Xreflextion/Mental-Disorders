<h2>What are anxiety disorders?</h2>

<p>Anxiety disorders are a group of mental disorders that cause 
	consistent anxiety and fearful thoughts every passing day. 
	The fearful and anxious thoughts can be overwhelming for them,
	but with treatments such as medication and therapy, it will 
	become more bearable.
</p>

<p> Six common anxiety disorders are:</p>

<p class= "font2"> Generalized Anxiety Disorder </p>

<p> Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by 
	unprovoked worry and anxiety. Someone with GAD will often worry about everything, 
	even something as normal as walking down a hall. These worries interfere 
	with one’s everyday life and make it difficult to complete everyday tasks.
</p>

<p class= "font2"> Panic Disorders</p>

<p>Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder where people experience unexpected 
	and recurring panic attacks. They start to worry about future panic attacks 
	and fear that something bad might happen at the next panic attack. Just because 
	one gets a panic attack doesn’t mean they have panic disorder though. Some things 
	can trigger a panic attack, such as stress or fear. However, one has a panic
	disorder when panic attacks occur for no clear reason, which drives fear into
	the affected person.
</p>

<p class= "font">Panic Attacks</p>

<P>Panic attacks are sudden rushes of intense fear that appear
	when there is no danger, and trigger physical reactions such as:
</P>

<ol>
	<li> Rapid heartbeat </li>
	<li> Shaking or trembling</li>
	<li>Nausea or dizziness</li>
	<li>Sweating</li>
	<li>Numbness or tingling sensations</li>
	<li>Chills or hot flashes</li>
	<li>Feelings of being choked</li>
</ol>

<p class= "font2">Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</p>

<p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that develops
	after witnessing or experiencing a traumatic event. This leads to symptoms 
	such as flashbacks, nightmares, or anxiety about the past event. 
</p>

<p>More symptoms include:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Re-experiencing the event through nightmares and flashbacks </li>
	<li>Avoiding places, people, or activities that are reminders of the traumatic event</li>
	<li>Distress or physical reactions to things that are reminders of the event </li>
	<li>Negative thoughts about world, others, or self</li>
	<li> Inability to remember important aspects of the event</li>
	<li> Trouble sleeping</li>
</ol>

<p class= "font2" id= "#obsessive"> Obsessive Compulsive Disorder </p>

<p>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder where people have unwanted,
	recurring thoughts or urges that cause discomfort and distress (obsessions), causing 
	them to repeat a specific action to bring temporary relief (compulsions). The 
	repetitive actions can cause great distress and interfere with a person’s daily 
	life. Most people with OCD know or suspect that the obsessions are not true, 
	however, the compulsive activities are still done regardless. 
</p>

<p> Generally, the obsessions revolve around a loved one or their self being harmed 
	unless they complete a specific action repeatedly. The compulsive actions involve:
</p>

<ol>
	<li> Washing or cleaning</li>
	<li> Ordering or arranging</li>
	<li> Mental actions</li>
	<li> Checking or double-checking</li>
	<li> Counting, tapping, touching, or rubbing</li>
</ol>

<p class= "font2">Social Anxiety Disorder </p>

<p>Social anxiety disorder is a mental disorder in which one feels 
	an overwhelming amount of stress and discomfort during social situations. 
	Social contact that may appear normal to others-such as keeping eye contact 
	or making small conversation- would make one feel uncomfortable, to the point 
	of avoiding social situations altogether. Social anxiety disorder varies 
	amongst different people. One person could be able to talk one-on-one, but be 
	unable to go into a crowded room. Another might be good at talking in a small 
	group, but freeze up in a big group of strangers.  </p>

<p>A few general symptoms include:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Fear of being judged, embarrassed, or humiliated</li>
	<li>Dizziness</li>
	<li>Stomach trouble</li>
	<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
	<li>Fear of offending others or being in the center of attention</li>
</ol>

<p class= "font2"> Phobic Disorders </p>

<p>Phobic disorders (Phobias) are irrational fears of a specific situation, object,
	animals, or activity. One with a phobia will feel intense fear towards the specific 
	situation or thing, and will attempt to avoid it at all costs. Though most recognize 
	the irrationality of their phobias, usually the thought is already enough to create 
	anxiety and fear.
</p>

<p>When faced with the specific phobia, one might feel:</p>

<ol>  
	<li> Fast heartbeaat</li>
	<li> Difficulty breathing</li>
	<li>Trembling or shaking</li>
	<li>Sweating</li>
	<li>Overwhelming anxiety or fear</li>
	<li>Urge to escape</li>

</ol>
