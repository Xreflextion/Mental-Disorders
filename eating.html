<h2>What are eating disorders?</h2>

<div>Eating disorders are mental illnesses that describe abnormal eating habits 
  and an obsessive concern over body weight. This leads to either insufficient 
  or extreme consumption of food, which causes harm to the body. The most common 
  eating disorders include 
  <a href= "#ano"> <u> anorexia nervosa</u></a>
  ,  <a href= "#bul" > <u>bulimia nervosa</u></a>, and 
  <a href= "#bin" > <u>binge eating disorder</u></a>.
</div>

<p class= "font" id= "ano">Anorexia Nervosa </p>

<p>Anorexia nervosa is a mental health condition where the affected person has an 
  overwhelming fear of gaining weight, and an unrealistic view of body image. 
  They generally see themselves as overweight, even when they are clearly underweight. 
  People with anorexia nervosa will severly limit the calories that they are consuming, 
  which could end in multiple organ failures, or even death.
</p>

<p>Anorexia nervosa is divided into two categories, restricting type and binging/purging type. </p>

<p><b>Restricting type</b></p>

<p>People with the restricting type tend to restrict the food they eat, and attempt to lose 
  weight by consuming less calories, or exercising.  
</p>

<p><b>Binging/Purging type</b></p>

<p>Someone with the binging/purging type would remove the food from their body after every 
  meal by vomiting, using laxatives, or exercising excessively. This lessens the guilt of 
  consuming any types of food they believe are unhealthy or restricted.
</p>

<p>Some signs that someone may have anorexia nervosa include:</p>

<ol> 
  <li> Excessive weight loss/appearing underweight compared to others with similar age and height</li>
  <li> Restricting food consumption </li>
  <li>Less social interactions</li>
  <li>Sensitivity to cold</li>
  <li>Absense of menustration</li>
  <li>Thinning or losing hair</li>
  <li>Growing &nbsp; <div class="definitionDD">

<p class= "font" id= "bul">Bulimia Nervosa</p>

<img src= "food.jpg" style= "float:right; border-radius: 50%;">

<p>Bulimia nervosa is characterized by 
  consuming a large amount of food in a short period of time, before purging it afterwards. 
  During the binging episodes, the person feels unable to control the amount of food they eat, 
  and are only able to stop after they become extremely full. To relieve themselves of the guilt 
  from binging, people with bulimia nervosa often purge afterwards, by puking, using laxatives, 
  or exercising. 
</p>

<p>Some general symptoms include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Obsessing over gaining weight</li>
  <li>Repeated episodes of uncontrollable binging</li>
  <li>Forced purging after binging episodes</li>
  <li>Binging/purging is usually done in secret</li>
</ol>

<p class= "font" id= "bin">Binge Eating Disorder </p>

<p>Similar to the bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder is a mental disorder in which people 
  eat large amounts of food in a period of time. The difference between binge eating disorder 
  and bulimia nervosa is that people with binge eating disorder donâ€™t purge the food they 
  consumed. As a result, most with the disorder end up overweight or obese. They generally 
  feel embarrassed of their binging periods, but are unable to control it and end up binging again. 
</p>

<p>Some symptoms of binge eating disorder are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Consuming large amounts of food over a period of time</li>
  <li>Rapidly eating until excessively full, regardless of feeling hungry or not</li>
  <li>Binging in secret </li>
  <li>Attempting to diet, usually without success</li>
  <li>Feeling guilt or shame from the binging</li>
</ol>
